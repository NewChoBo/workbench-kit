# Workbench Kit Northstar Implementation Plan

This document decomposes [`target-architecture.md`](./target-architecture.md) and its detailed Northstar decisions into ordered, tool-neutral implementation packets.

It is not a changelog of the current repository. Current source is recorded only as evidence for a CURRENT → TARGET gap or as an implementation result to review.

## Status model

- `DESIGNING` — target architecture/API/ownership decisions remain open
- `READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION` — architecture decisions are sufficiently closed for an implementation-only agent
- `IMPLEMENTING` — source work exists in a separate implementation lane
- `SOURCE_REVIEW_REQUIRED` — implementation exists and must be reviewed against target
- `REVISION_REQUIRED` — implementation deviates materially from target/acceptance
- `BLOCKED` — dependency/release/high-authority decision prevents implementation
- `DONE` — implementation, source review, compatibility/migration and cleanup satisfy target
- `SUPERSEDED` — a newer target/packet replaced the work

## READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION quality bar

A packet must define:

- target capability and outcome;
- target ownership/package/module boundary;
- relevant classes/services/models/controllers and responsibilities;
- target public API/types/subpaths/schema/events;
- state source-of-truth and data/event flow;
- lifecycle/concurrency/error/persistence semantics when applicable;
- scope/non-scope;
- ordered implementation tasks;
- compatibility/migration/cleanup;
- focused tests and repository validation;
- backendless/browser/Electron/native test layer;
- performance workload/budget where material;
- acceptance/done criteria;
- source-review checklist;
- no unresolved material architecture decision.

No packet status or contract names a specific coding agent.

## Target dependency graph

Recursive design has identified extension/kernel responsibility separation as a foundation before adding more public abstraction. UI authoring adds a second target chain that must inventory/reuse existing schema/layout primitives before creating new public contracts.

        ↓
Workflow runtime + published interfaces
        ↓
Host adapter maturation / multi-host validation
        ↓
Backendless/performance + compatibility hardening
```

`WB-NS-001A` is intentionally internal-first: it reduces responsibility coupling without requiring a new public service container, package family or extension isolation runtime.

UI packet IDs `WB-NS-070*` / `WB-NS-071*` are canonical target slots but remain `DESIGNING` until source/API inventory proves reuse boundaries and prevents a parallel schema/layout system.

# Active target packets

## WB-NS-001A — Runtime extension responsibility decomposition

- **Status:** `READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION`
- **Target:** [`extension-composition-boundary.md`](./extension-composition-boundary.md)
- **Ownership:** `GENERIC_KIT`
- **Reviewed source baseline:** `develop@6466359c8f1c48c18cb0dc41659d322a1a0ecd55`
- **Public API impact:** none required in this slice

### Goal

Split catalog/inventory, manifest contribution routing, executable activation and runtime API construction behind the existing public `ExtensionRegistry` compatibility facade.

This closes the highest-value kernel/extension responsibility gap without introducing a global DI/service-locator API or forcing process isolation.

### CURRENT SOURCE FACT

Current `ExtensionRegistry` directly owns:

- extension description storage;
- dependency/cycle diagnostics;
- declarative contribution registration;
- active/activating state;
- activation/deactivation and lifecycle events;
- `ExtensionContext` construction;
- capability registration/access;
- command activation/execution;
- lifetime of multiple contribution registries.

`WorkbenchProvider` also exposes the aggregate registry through React context. The public `workbench-core` barrel exports `ExtensionRegistry`, so deleting or radically replacing it in the first slice would create avoidable compatibility churn.

### TARGET roles

Internal names may vary only when responsibility boundaries remain equivalent.

```text
ExtensionInventory
ExtensionContributionRouter
ExtensionActivationService
ExtensionApiFactory
ExtensionRegistry compatibility facade
```

#### `ExtensionInventory`

Owns registered `WorkbenchExtensionDescription` identity/list/get/register semantics only.

Target contract:

```ts
interface ExtensionInventory {
  get(extensionId: string): WorkbenchExtensionDescription | undefined;
  list(): readonly WorkbenchExtensionDescription[];
  register(description: WorkbenchExtensionDescription): Disposable;
}
```

#### `ExtensionContributionRouter`

Registers manifest-declared contributions into explicit focused contribution registries and returns their disposable lifetime. It does not activate executable code and does not become a universal registry.

#### `ExtensionActivationService`

Owns:

- active and in-flight activation state;
- activation-event matching;
- dependency-before-dependent activation;
- lifecycle events;
- deactivate/deactivate-all;
- activation subscription lifetime.

It does not own command execution or host composition.

#### `ExtensionApiFactory`

Creates the existing restricted `ExtensionContext` from explicit registration/capability facades, extension identity/path, manifest permissions/capabilities and activation subscription scope.

It does not expose host composition internals.

#### Compatibility facade

Public `ExtensionRegistry` stays source-compatible in this slice and delegates to the focused roles.

### Target data/lifecycle flow

```text
registerExtension(description)
  → ExtensionInventory.register
  → ExtensionContributionRouter.registerManifestContributions
  → compatibility facade owns combined registration disposable

activation event / explicit activation
  → ExtensionActivationService
  → dependency analysis + inventory lookup
  → ExtensionApiFactory.createContext
  → module.activate(context)
  → active state + subscriptions

executeCommand(commandId)
  → compatibility facade (for current API)
  → ExtensionActivationService.activateByEvent(onCommand)
  → CommandRegistry/CommandService executes handler
```

Manifest contribution lifetime and executable activation lifetime remain distinct.

### Scope

1. Extract inventory/description ownership.
2. Extract manifest contribution routing using existing normalizers and focused registries.
3. Extract active/activating lifecycle and activation operations.
4. Extract `ExtensionContext` construction.
5. Make current `ExtensionRegistry` delegate while preserving its public methods/options/getters.
6. Keep current `CapabilityRegistry` semantics scoped; do not turn it into host-wide service discovery.
7. Add focused unit tests for extracted roles plus facade regression coverage.

### Non-scope

- no public `ExtensionRegistry` removal;
- no new public generic DI/container API;
- no mandatory worker/process/remote extension host;
- no manifest schema change;
- no shell React-context migration yet;
- no new capability ID inventory;
- no persisted-format or installation-flow redesign.

### Compatibility and migration

- preserve `ExtensionRegistryOptions` and public barrel exports;
- preserve current `ExtensionContext` public shape;
- preserve manifest contribution-before-activation behavior;
- preserve duplicate-ID, missing-dependency, cycle, activation coalescing, permission/capability and disposal behavior;
- any new focused classes remain internal until independent consumer value justifies public exposure.

### Verification layer

`PURE_WEB / backendless core`.

No Electron/native dependency is intrinsic to this slice.

### Focused tests

At minimum cover:

- inventory duplicate registration + disposal;
- declarative contribution registration without executable activation;
- dependency and activation-event behavior;
- concurrent same-extension activation coalescing;
- activation failure does not mark active;
- deactivation/disposal order;
- permission/capability access through created context;
- current public `ExtensionRegistry` behavior remains compatible.

Current source area to reuse/extend: `packages/workbench-core/src/extension/registry.test.ts` plus focused tests beside extracted internal roles.

### Repository validation

Use the repository's current required commit-safety and applicable fast/full validation from the exact implementation head. Do not weaken gates for this packet.

### Acceptance / Done criteria

- the old `ExtensionRegistry` implementation body no longer contains all inventory, contribution, activation and API-construction behavior;
- extracted roles are directly testable and have one primary responsibility;
- public consumers compile without migration;
- no new arbitrary service lookup or host composition object reaches `ExtensionContext`;
- command execution remains command-layer responsibility after extension activation;
- contribution and activation lifetimes remain distinct;
- source review confirms no accidental public-export/bundle growth;
- compatibility facade remains a migration boundary, not a new target dependency for features.

### Source-review checklist

Reject the implementation if:

- extracted classes are wrappers that delegate substantive behavior back to the old aggregate;
- one new replacement class simply recreates the same god object;
- runtime extensions gain broader internal access;
- `CapabilityRegistry` is generalized into host service lookup;
- contribution registries become owned by activation lifecycle;
- command execution moves into `ExtensionActivationService`;
- concurrent activation or disposal semantics regress;
- public API expands without packet justification.

### Discovery decision

`ADOPT`: separate trusted host/application composition from runtime installable extension API/lifecycle.

Evidence: official Theia architecture separates compile-time application extensions/DI from installable plugin mechanisms; official VS Code architecture runs installable extensions through extension hosts and manifest/activation contracts.

`DEFER`: mandatory worker/process/remote extension isolation until untrusted-extension, responsiveness-isolation, remote-workspace or placement requirements justify serialization/runtime cost.

`REJECT`: public global DI/service locator for runtime extensions.

Falsifier for the deferred isolation decision: a committed product requirement needs untrusted third-party execution, remote workspace placement or extension CPU/failure isolation.

## WB-NS-001B — Shell dependency narrowing

- **Status:** `DESIGNING`
- **Target:** [`extension-composition-boundary.md`](./extension-composition-boundary.md)
- **Ownership:** `GENERIC_KIT`
- **Dependency:** `WB-NS-001A`

### Goal

Stop shell/features from depending on the aggregate `ExtensionRegistry` when a focused service is sufficient.

### Design work still required

Inventory each current `shell-react` use of `extensionRegistry` and classify it as:

```text
activation
command
contribution read
extension management/catalog
capability access
other
```

Then define the smallest focused context/facade per category and a compatibility/deprecation path. Do not delegate until that inventory proves the target React context shape.

## WB-NS-010 — Graph document/controller/renderer/runtime separation

- **Status:** `DESIGNING`
- **Target:** `target-architecture.md` § Graph architecture
- **Ownership:** `GENERIC_KIT`

### Goal

Make graph structure, editing/controller behavior, rendering integration, and executable workflow runtime independently replaceable and testable.

### Target roles

```text
GraphDocumentModel
GraphInteractionController
GraphRendererAdapter
WorkflowRuntime
```

### Design questions to close

- map these roles to current Field Remap/flow packages without duplicating source-of-truth;
- determine whether document transactions/undo belong in a reusable document transaction primitive or graph-specific layer;
- define renderer-owned presentation metadata vs document-owned layout metadata;
- define migration path for existing graph persisted shapes;
- define target public subpaths after package-map/source review.

Do not delegate implementation until these are closed.

## WB-NS-020 — Projection ownership and round-trip contracts

- **Status:** `DESIGNING`
- **Target:** `target-architecture.md` § Projection architecture
- **Ownership:** `GENERIC_KIT`

### Goal

Allow one underlying document/workflow to support full graph, GUI builder, form/inspector, code/schema, preview and simplified end-user presentation without hidden competing sources of truth.

### Target contract

Every projection declares:

```text
AUTHORITATIVE_EDITABLE
ROUND_TRIP_EDITABLE
DERIVED_READ_ONLY
RUNTIME_ONLY
```

### Design questions

- projection descriptor/API shape;
- round-trip conflict/transaction model;
- projection-local state vs canonical document state;
- how end-user published interfaces hide internal nodes/components;
- which projection mechanics should be generic vs tool-specific.

## WB-NS-030 — Shared field schema / form / inspector architecture

- **Status:** `DESIGNING`
- **Target:** `target-architecture.md` § Schema/form/inspector
- **Ownership:** `GENERIC_KIT`

### Goal

Use one semantic field-schema foundation to drive forms, property inspectors, settings, graph node widgets and wizards while allowing different UX/renderers.

### Target roles

```text
FieldSchemaRegistry
FieldEditorRegistry
ValidationService
FormModel
InspectorModel
```

### Source review required

Inventory current field-schema, Field Remap, settings/form/inspector APIs before finalizing new public contracts. Reuse/consolidation is preferred over a parallel schema system.

## WB-NS-040 — Extension capability / trust / compatibility model

- **Status:** `DESIGNING`
- **Target:** `target-architecture.md` § Extension/plugin architecture + [`extension-composition-boundary.md`](./extension-composition-boundary.md)
- **Ownership:** `GENERIC_KIT`
- **Dependency:** `WB-NS-001A`

### Goal

Extensions declare contributions, required/optional capabilities, compatibility, permissions/trust, activation and explicit degradation without arbitrary internal reach-through.

### Target roles

```text
ExtensionManifest
ExtensionResolver
ExtensionActivationService
PermissionService
TrustService
ContributionRouter
```

The activation/contribution responsibility boundary is now owned by `WB-NS-001A`; this packet focuses on trust, compatibility and degradation semantics rather than recreating extension orchestration.

### Design questions

- current manifest compatibility/version fields and gaps;
- capability negotiation shape;
- permission/trust granularity;
- activation failure/degradation state;
- lockfile/dependency relation;
- public SDK vs internal service surfaces.

## WB-NS-050 — Focused host capability boundary foundation

- **Status:** `DONE`
- **Target:** `target-architecture.md` § Host/platform architecture + [`host-capability-boundary.md`](./host-capability-boundary.md)
- **Ownership:** `GENERIC_KIT`
- **Source-review result:** `NARROWED`
- **Reviewed source baseline:** `develop@b11e21a91634830626fdcde7758b32dff0dd26ef`

### Resolved target

Workbench Kit owns focused, typed, product-neutral ports and host-adapter leaves. It does **not** require or expose one application-wide public host/service registry.

The current `CapabilityRegistry<TCapability>` target role remains a scoped composition concept unless independent consumers prove a stable public registry contract.

### Current implementation evidence

The current source already provides the boundary foundation:

- `@workbench-kit/platform` exposes focused framework-neutral leaves;
- `@workbench-kit/electron-shell` exposes focused Electron security/lifecycle/window/preload leaves;
- preload helpers wrap allowlisted invoke/subscribe operations rather than exposing renderer transport primitives;
- product IPC names, paths and policy remain integrating-host concerns.

### Why this packet is DONE

The original packet implicitly treated the candidate capability list as a future generic API inventory. Source review and external platform guidance support a narrower target: the reusable architectural rule is the **focused boundary**, while future capability leaves are demand-driven.

No broad capability registry/provider implementation is justified by current evidence, so creating one would add speculative API surface rather than close a proven gap.

### Deferred candidate

A public generic capability registry/provider remains `DEFER`.

Falsifier: two or more independent public consumers demonstrate the same registration, lookup, availability and lifecycle semantics and cannot be served cleanly through focused ports and host composition.

### Future packet rule

Create a new host-capability packet only for a concrete missing generic capability. Such a packet must define:

- neutral behavior contract;
- `platform` vs `electron-shell` ownership;
- exact focused public package/subpath;
- host-injected policy and transport boundary;
- browser/desktop availability semantics;
- packed external-consumer validation;
- compatibility and release dependency.

Candidate families such as FileSystem, Process, Clipboard and Notification remain discovery candidates, not a required implementation checklist.

## WB-NS-060 — Backendless scenario + performance harness

- **Status:** `DESIGNING`
- **Target:** `target-architecture.md` § Test/performance architecture
- **Ownership:** `GENERIC_KIT`

### Goal

Make generic workbench/layout/editor/graph/form surfaces easy to instantiate with deterministic in-memory capabilities and representative SMALL/TYPICAL/STRESS workloads.

### Target layers

```text
Domain fixtures
Capability fake adapters
Scenario builders
Renderer/browser harness
Minimal real-host canaries
Performance workloads + budgets
```

### Ready gate

Define ownership and API boundaries for fixtures without turning production packages into test-framework containers; identify representative workloads from actual hot paths before budgets are standardized.

## WB-NS-070 — Manual-first UI layout/style authoring foundation

- **Status:** `DESIGNING`
- **Target:** [`ui-authoring-and-generative-composition.md`](./ui-authoring-and-generative-composition.md) + [`layout-and-style-authoring.md`](./layout-and-style-authoring.md)
- **Ownership:** `GENERIC_KIT`
- **Related:** `WB-NS-020`, `WB-NS-030`

### Goal

Allow users to construct UI manually from typed values/resources and atomic components, select valid layout structures, edit CSS-compatible design values through contextual Inspector/Canvas surfaces, create composites/templates, and persist one renderer-neutral canonical UI document. AI later gains parity over the same command model but is not required.

### Target decomposition

```text
WB-NS-070A typed value/property/source inventory + contract
WB-NS-070B selectable layout strategy + typed style constraints
WB-NS-070C atomic component + composite descriptor contract
WB-NS-070D UiDocument command/direct-manipulation authoring
WB-NS-070E responsive variants + design tokens/resources
WB-NS-070F provider-neutral generative UI parity
```

### Required source/API inventory before delegation

Review and map at minimum:

- existing field/schema/editor descriptor APIs;
- shell/workbench layout and SplitView semantics;
- Field Remap typed fields/ports and transform value registry;
- theme/tokens/CSS custom-property ownership if present;
- settings/forms/inspectors and renderer property editors;
- persistence/versioning primitives relevant to a future `UiDocument`;
- current command/context/undo transaction capabilities.

The target must reuse or deliberately consolidate these semantics rather than adding a parallel universal schema system.

### `WB-NS-070A` ready gate

Close:

- which existing semantic schema is reused vs adapted;
- typed value source model (`literal | token | resource | binding | expression` or equivalent);
- renderer-neutral unit/value boundaries;
- validation/editor metadata ownership;
- public vs internal API placement.

### `WB-NS-070B` ready gate

Close:

- supported layout strategy descriptor contract;
- container vs child property ownership;
- context-valid Inspector property groups;
- typed sizing/spacing/flex/grid/split/canvas semantics;
- invalid combination behavior;
- renderer projection and raw-CSS escape-hatch boundary.

### `WB-NS-070C` ready gate

Close component descriptor identity/version, properties/events/bindings/layout/accessibility/design-time metadata, registry contribution path, and composite public interface semantics.

### `WB-NS-070D` ready gate

Close `UiDocument` node identity/tree model, commands/typed patches, transaction/undo behavior, Canvas↔Inspector parity, selection/hierarchy ownership, and persistence boundary.

### `WB-NS-070E` ready gate

Close responsive/host-width/state variants, design tokens/resources/theme projection, stable token identity and migration semantics.

### `WB-NS-070F` ready gate

Depends on the manual contract. Generative UI may be delegated only after manual commands/validation are sufficient to express the same target operations. It emits reviewable proposals/typed patches and may not introduce arbitrary JSX/HTML/CSS execution as canonical state.

### Acceptance direction

The completed chain must permit an AI-disabled host to:

- choose Stack/Flex/Grid/Split/Canvas-style layout where supported;
- set width/height/min/max, margin/padding/gap, alignment, typography, color, borders/radius/shadow and other approved typed properties;
- choose literal/token/resource/binding/expression sources where allowed;
- manipulate Canvas and Inspector interchangeably;
- author responsive variants;
- compose primitives into reusable components/templates;
- validate/preview/undo/persist without an AI provider.

## WB-NS-071 — Graph node/property authoring and development escalation

- **Status:** `DESIGNING`
- **Target:** [`ui-authoring-and-generative-composition.md`](./ui-authoring-and-generative-composition.md)
- **Ownership:** `GENERIC_KIT`
- **Related:** `WB-NS-010`, `WB-NS-030`, `WB-NS-070`

### Goal

Support typed graph node descriptors and the useful editor↔connectable-input duality while providing a safe escalation path when users/agents request capabilities not present in the current component/node catalog.

### Target decomposition

```text
WB-NS-071A NodeTypeDescriptor / typed port + property foundation
WB-NS-071B missing capability -> component/node development requirement
WB-NS-071C external node ecosystem adapter contract
optional ComfyUI adapter experiment
```

### Direction

- node descriptor, node instance, renderer and runtime remain distinct;
- properties become connectable only when their schema explicitly supports it;
- composite/subgraph nodes reuse existing capabilities before source-code node creation;
- code-backed missing capabilities become tool-neutral implementation requirements handled by the separate implementation lane;
- external ecosystems are adapters, not canonical Workbench runtime/schema ownership.

### ComfyUI discovery

Evaluate typed input/output compatibility, widget/input duality, custom-node schema/versioning and editor metadata as reusable interaction/schema principles. Do not copy ComfyUI runtime/frontend internals or make Workbench dependent on them.

# Implementation source-review protocol

When an implementation branch/PR appears:

1. freeze its exact head;
2. inspect actual diff plus surrounding owner modules/tests;
3. compare it with the target packet, not only the previous source;
4. check ownership, dependency direction, public API growth, state/source-of-truth, lifecycle/concurrency, persistence/migration, backendless testability, performance and compatibility;
5. record one result:
   - `CONFIRMED`
   - `NARROWED`
   - `REVISION_REQUIRED`
   - `SUPERSEDED`
   - `DONE`;
6. update downstream packets if the implementation changed a validated target assumption.

If the implementation demonstrates a better architecture, revise the target with explicit rationale instead of forcing stale design.
